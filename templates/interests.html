          <p> Stars in the mass range between 1 and 8 solar masses go through the planetary nebula (PN) phase before ending their lives as white dwarfs. The optical image of a PN is dominated by the luminous ionised envelope that is powered by the stellar core at its centre.</p>
          
          <p>The envelope emits in several strong lines from the UV to the NIR, and Dopita et al. showed that up to 15% of the luminosity of the central star is re-emitted in the forbidden [OIII] line at &#955;5007&#8491;. Thanks to their their bright [OIII] (&#955;5007&#8491;) and faint continuum emission, extragalactic PNs can be identified as objects detected in images taken through the on-band [OIII] filter, but not detected in images taken through the off-band continuum filter.</p>
          
          <p>Making use of a deep survey for PNs covering the halo of the cD galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster, I extracted PN candidates using an automatic extraction procedure based on the distribution of the detected sources in colour- magnitude diagrams. We obtained one of the largest extragalactic PN samples both in number of tracers (∼700) and in radial extent (∼150 kpc from the galaxy’s centre). All PN candidates satisfied the conditions of being point-like objects with colour excess corresponding to an observed EW in the [OIII] emission greater than 110&#8491;, after convolution with photometric errors as function of the magnitude.</p>

        <p>The observed properties of the PN population in external galaxies correlate with the age and metallicity of the parent stellar population. These properties are: the luminosity-specific PN number, or &alpha; parameter, that quantifies the stellar luminosity associated with a detected PN, and the shape of the PN luminosity function (PNLF).</p>

        <p>Observationally the values of &alpha; correlate with the integrated (B-V) colour of the parent stellar population, with the spread in observed values for the reddest galaxies increasing significantly with respect to the constant value observed in bluer ((B-V) &gt; 0.8)) objects. For the reddest galaxies, the value of &alpha; correlates with the (FUV-V) colour, with the lowest number of PNs observed in old and metal-rich systems.</p>

        <p>To describe the shape of the PNLF for extragalactic PN populations, the analytical formula proposed by
        Ciardullo et al. has generally been used. At the brightest magnitudes the PNLF shows a cutoff that is observed to be invariant between different Hubble types and from about one magnitude fainter than the PNLF cutoff, the analytical formula predicts an exponential increase, in agreement with the slow PN fading rate described by Henize &amp; Westerlund. Observationally, the PNLF slope correlates with the star formation history of the parent stellar population, with steeper slopes observed in older stellar
        populations and flat or slightly decreasing slopes in younger populations.</p>

        <p>We investigate the diffuse light in the outer regions of the nearby elliptical galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster, using PNs as tracers. Thanks to the radial extent of our PN sample we see for the first time that the logarithmic density profile of the PN distribution is shallower than the surface brightness profile at large radii. I proposed a photometric model for the PN population, showing that this behaviour is consistent with the superposition of two components associated with the halo of M87 and with the ICL, which have different luminosity specific PN numbers, the ICL contributing three times more PNs per unit light. Because of the magnitude depth of this survey we are also able to study the shape of the PN luminosity function (PNLF) in the outer regions of M87. We find a slope for the PNLF that is steeper at fainter magnitudes than the standard analytical PNLF formula. Therefore we carried out a comparison with the benchmark for PNLF studies, the M31 bulge. The comparison of the M87 halo PNLF with the M31 bulge PNLF, when both are normalised by the sampled bolometric luminosity, shows that the former has fewer PNs at bright magnitudes, and a steeper slope towards the faint end. The steepening of the PNLF at fainter magnitudes is consistent with a larger fraction of PNs with low mass cores. PN evolution models and stellar population measurements at la rge radii will be needed to understand the stellar population effects that shape the PNLF of the M87 halo.</p>

    M87.II. Kinematical separation of its stellar halo and intracluster light</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p> The formation of extended halos around brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) is closely related to the
              morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters (Murante04,Murante07). Studying the light, spatial distribution and kinematics of these stellar components provides crucial information in understanding the evolution of galaxies and their host cluster (Dolag10,Contini14).  Utilising photometric observation, obtained with Subaru-CAM, we acquired a sample of Planetary Nebulas (PNs) in order to investigate the diffuse light in the outer regions of the elliptical galaxy M87,close to the dynamical centre of the Virgo cluster (the nearest large scale structure in the local universe). Following their strong [OIII] emission line, PN line-of-sight velocities can be successfully measured via spectroscopy further away from the galaxy centre, mapping kinematically the outer regions of elliptical galaxies.</p>
          
          <p> Spectra were acquired in service mode with the FLAMES spectrograph in the GIRAFFE+MEDUSA              configuration, which allows up to 132 separate objects to be observed in one plate configuration of 20
          arcmin diameter. The high-resolution grism HR08 was used, covering a wavelength range of 125 &#8491;, centred on 5048 &#8491;, and a spectral resolution of 20 000. With this setup the instrumental broadening of the arc lines is 17 km/s and the error on the wavelength measurements is 150 m/s. As the [OIII] emission lines from PNs are only a few km/s broad, relatively high resolution spectra are desirable in order to reduce the sky contamination, making FLAMES spectrograph an ideal instrument involved in the identification of PN kinematics.  I used the projected phase-space distribution (VLOS-R) to tag kinematically the PNs and assign membership to either halo or ICL. The velocity distribution shows, indeed clear sign of bimodality and it is well fitted by the sum of two gaussians ( one narrower and one broader) that reflects the overlapping of a colder halo and a hotter ICL.  I have studied the spatial distribution of such components and confirm the theoretical results (Dolag10 where the density profile of the bound component (halo) is observed to be much steeper and less curved than that of the diffuse component (ICL). The composite PN number density profile from halo+ICL is consistent with a two component photometric model (Longobardi13) where the ICL component is found to contribute three times more PNs than the bound halo population. This is consistent with a gradient towards bluer colours at large radii and to a gradient in metallicity with higher values associated to the halo with respect to the ICL. This answered the question as to whether the ICL is made up of the same stars that build the outer halo of M87 and as to whether the stellar populations are different. Our evidence suggests that they have a different underlying stellar population, different in terms of star formation histories and metallicity. Moreover, the halo density profile shows symmetry when studied separately for the PN sample to the north and to the south of M87. This is in contrast with recent result published for the globular cluster ditribution. The resulting conclusion is that if the M87 halo has been accreted these events are not recent.
